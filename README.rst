django-revkom
=============

Django-revkom is Adam Wright's in vitro development repository. Living between
code specific to projects and thouroughly generic, sharable Python packages,
this repository acts as an experimental staging area.

Currently working on:

- revkom-settings: Generic, modular, easy Django settings with execfiles()!
- revkom-helpers: Utilities and mixins required by revkom spin-off projects

Currently extracting:

- django-sassmouth: A Django Staticfiles backend for compiling SASS/SCSS

In the pipeline:

- django-hostess: virtual host/subdomain processing
  [different philosophy to django-subdomains]
- django-cinch: Code is not configuration, hey?
    - generic, modular, easy Django settings with execfiles()
    - read settings from ini files??
