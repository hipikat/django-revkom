# settings/default.py
#
# These are the default settings used by manage.py and the default wsgi
# application instance when no DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment
# variable is set. They provide the minimum configuration needed to
# create a running server or invoke a Django shell. Generally, a
# DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable should be set. The author
# suggests a postactivate hook in the project's virtual environment.
